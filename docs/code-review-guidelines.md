1. Open a PR to `true-head` (NOT `green-head`)
2. Request all other teammates as reviewers
3. As a reviewer, ask the following:
    * Is it technically correct?
    * Is it easy for other team members to understand?
    * Does it have good style/follow conventions?
    * Is it documented?
    * Does it pass all tests?
    * Do design choices make sense to you?
4. Either approve the PR or send it back for review with specific comments
    * Comments can happen on the PR in GitHub, or in person discussion if all members are present
5. Once a PR has at least one approval and it passes tests, it can be merged and the branch can be deleted.
