* Decide what should be hooks / actions
    * See [Miro](https://miro.com/app/board/uXjVPPnKrBo=/)

## Google Maps API
* [Distance Matrix API](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/distance-matrix)
    * complete bipartite graph between origin vector and destination vector

    * there's probably a python library for this
    * MUST be noodle themed.
