As a team, we value collaboration and communication highly, as they enable us to work together both synchronously and asynchronously. We value asking for help and feedback early and often, as catching mistakes and confusion early minimizes their impact and lets us all keep contributing productively. We also value having enjoyable team meetings, and we like to support that by having snacks available. Lastly, we place a lot of value on having high-quality code written, we'd rather have less functionality but better tested and thought out code than a larger amount of incomprehensible gibberish.
